    "text": "Hi,\nThis is Heba Nusair, a Ph.D. Candidate in Landscape Architecture at Virginia Tech. My doctoral research focuses on predicting the impact of the Work-from-Home paradigm on urban sprawl using Agent-Based Models and Artificial Intelligence.\nBut that’s not all – I’m here to share my findings with you through a series of engaging blog posts. In some of these, I’ve even used synthesized data sets to shed light on different facets of the outcomes. So, whether you’re passionate about urban planning or just curious about the future of work, I invite you to join me in exploring these fascinating insights.\nLet’s dive into the world of urban development and the changing nature of work.\nI hope you enjoy reading!\n\nImage provided by Shutterstock"
